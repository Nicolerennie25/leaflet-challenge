### Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet
This project visualizes earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet, a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps.


### Overview
The project fetches earthquake data in GeoJSON format from the USGS API and displays it on a Leaflet map. Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker whose size corresponds to its magnitude and color reflects its depth. Clicking on a marker displays additional information about the earthquake.

### Features
Interactive map displaying earthquake data.
Circle markers sized by earthquake magnitude.
Marker colors indicate earthquake depth.
Popups with detailed information on each earthquake.
Legend providing context for depth colors.

### Technologies Used
Leaflet - JavaScript library for interactive maps.
USGS Earthquake API - Provides earthquake data in GeoJSON format.
Vanilla JavaScript - Used for data fetching, processing, and map rendering.
CSS - Custom styling for the map and legend.

### Acknowledgments
USGS for providing the earthquake data.
